See [article](https://medium.com/@nocnoc/cicd-for-flutter-fdc07fe52abd) for introduction to Fledge.

# Fledge: A CICD tool for Flutter
Automatically build, test, sign and release your Flutter app to both Apple and Google stores. 

Supports public and private build servers in the cloud (Travis, Cirrus, etc...) and in-house (Jenkins, GitLab, etc...).

There are many steps involved each time an app, or an app upgrade, is delivered to both stores. Fledge exists to document and automate these steps.

# Quick start
For example, with GitHub and Travis:

1. Install Fledge  
    ```
    $ pub global activate fledge
    ```

1. Add secrets  
    Set your secret variables in:  
    ```
    https://travis-ci.org/<your name>/<your repo>/settings
    ```
    ![secret variables](art/travis_secret_env.png)  
    These variables are used for signing and uploading to both stores.

1. Add app to Fledge  
    Install the Travis config file and Fastlane files
    ```bash
    $ fledge config -b travis
    ```

1. Start a beta  
    Run pipeline on Travis
    ```
    $ fledge beta
    ```
    This will build your app, upload to both store consoles and release to beta testers.

1. Release to users  
    ```
    $ fledge release
    ```
    This will release the app to users.

# Documentation

# Demo
For a demo of Fledge in action see: https://github.com/mmcc007/todo. Links are included to view the pipeline on Travis that delivers betas and releases to both stores.

The demo app was delivered automatically to both Google and Apple stores using a Fledge pipeline.

You can download the demo app to your android or iOS device:

### Fledge trace-back feature  
This feature allows you to track what version of your app is running on any device. Useful for support and bug-fixing.
 
 To use the Fledge trace-back feature, tap on the app title 'GitErDone' to view the 'About'.
