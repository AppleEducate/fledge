## Intro
Note: Only the CD (Continous Delivery) part of CICD is currently implemented. Unit testing would be relatively
easy to add to this setup. Integration testing involves adding emulators and simulators which 
requires more setup.

For a live example of
CI (Continous Integration) for Flutter, including unit and integration testing in the cloud,
see https://github.com/brianegan/flutter_architecture_samples.

Support for CI (Continuous Integration) will be added in an upcoming release of Fledge.
